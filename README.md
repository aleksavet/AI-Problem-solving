## Artificial Intelligence Course Assignments
This repository contains three assignments completed as part of a university course on Artificial Intelligence. The course aimed to provide a deeper understanding of AI principles, both symbolic and subsymbolic, and apply techniques for problem-solving through intelligent agent design.

## Assignment 1: 8-Puzzle Solver
Objective: Solve the 8-puzzle game using the A* algorithm and compare the performance of two different heuristics.
Description: The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space. The task is to find a sequence of moves that leads from an initial configuration to a target configuration by shifting tiles up, down, left, or right.
Language: Java

## Assignment 2: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver
Objective: Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using genetic algorithms, tabu search, and simulated annealing.
Description: The TSP involves finding the shortest route for a salesman to visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city, while minimizing the total travel distance. The assignment focuses on implementing and comparing genetic algorithm and tabu search for this problem.
Language: Java

## Assignment 3: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier
Objective: Develop a classifier for a 2D space using the k-NN algorithm to classify points into four different classes: red, green, blue, and purple.
Description: The classifier assigns a class to new points based on their (X, Y) coordinates and adds them to the 2D space. A simple GUI was created using the tkinter library.
Language: Python
Each assignment demonstrates practical experience with different AI techniques, solving both classic optimization problems and developing classifiers.
